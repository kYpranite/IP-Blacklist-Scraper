# IP-Blacklist-Scraper
Scrapes the FireHol Github and converts IPs into plaintext

## **Configuration**

If a specific set is wanted from the Firehol repository, edit the URL parameter in the configuration to the **raw text** URL.

Since these repositories are automatically updated, there is no need to update the code. Simply rerun the program and it will automatically provide an updated list.
